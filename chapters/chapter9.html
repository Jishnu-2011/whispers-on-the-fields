<p class='story-text'>THE REDEMPTION PROMISE</p>
<p class='story-text'>I sat alone that night under the rusted goalpost of our school’s forgotten training ground.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Rain soaked me to the bone.</p>
<p class='story-text'>I didn’t move.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Didn’t cry.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Didn’t speak.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Until I whispered:</p>
<p class='story-text'>“I will destroy them. I don’t care if it kills me.”</p>
<p class='story-text'>From that day on, I trained with one thought—rage.</p>
<p class='story-text'>I didn’t want to be like Raijin.</p>
<p class='story-text'>I didn’t want to be like Ryujin.</p>
<p class='story-text'>I wanted to become something else.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Something they couldn’t predict.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Something born from pain, from loss, from hate.</p>
<p class='story-text'>I would become the storm between light and shadow.</p>
<p class='story-text'>I would become Kamikaze.</p>
