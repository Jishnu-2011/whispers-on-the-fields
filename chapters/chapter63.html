<p class='story-text'>After defeating Noel Noa in a quiet, empty stadium under the dim lights, Kamikaze stood alone, chest heaving with exhaustion and disbelief. The silence was thick, broken only by his ragged breaths. Suddenly, from the shadows, Jin appeared, his expression unreadable but calm.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“You’ve taken down a legend,” Jin said quietly. “But this victory isn’t the end. It’s the start of something greater. I will train you — sharpen your body, your mind, and your Monster. Without distractions or crowds, we’ll focus on making you truly invincible.”</p>
<p class='story-text'>No cheers, no applause — just the sound of footsteps as Jin led Kamikaze deeper into the shadows, beginning the toughest training of his life.</p>
