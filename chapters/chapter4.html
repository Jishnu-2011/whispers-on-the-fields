<p class='story-text'>THE WAR WITHIN</p>
<p class='story-text'>After that day, something strange began to happen. Whenever the pressure hit its peak—when matches were high stakes and the crowd’s roar thundered in my ears—I would suddenly blackout. Not physically, but my consciousness would slip away like a fading shadow. And in that void, a presence awoke—a soul from a past self, an echo of the Kamikaze I once was. Without warning, this ghost would take control. My body would move with impossible speed, grace, and fury. It was as if another me was playing the game—fierce, untouchable, unstoppable. When I finally snapped back to reality, the match would be over. Victory or defeat, I had no memory of what happened. Just a hollow shell left behind to wonder what power I had unleashed.</p>
