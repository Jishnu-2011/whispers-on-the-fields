<p class='story-text'>PUSHING BEYOND LIMITS — THE RIVALRY BEGINS</p>
<p class='story-text'>Every day on the training ground, Kamikaze ran until his lungs burned and his legs trembled. He woke before dawn, sprinted through drills until the sun scorched his skin, and stayed late into the evening, perfecting every touch, every pass, every shot.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Zero was always there too — calm, precise, untouchable in his style. The coaches praised him, the teammates admired him, and Kamikaze felt the weight of being the “other.” The substitute. The shadow.</p>
<p class='story-text'>But inside Kamikaze, a fire was growing hotter than ever. Each time Zero scored, each time the crowd cheered his name, Kamikaze’s anger pushed him harder.</p>
<p class='story-text'>He wanted to break past the limit Zero represented — not just to prove himself, but to bring Japan the victory it had never known.</p>
<p class='story-text'>One afternoon, after an intense scrimmage, Zero walked past Kamikaze without a word. Their eyes met for a brief second — calm, confident, almost cold.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Kamikaze’s fists clenched.</p>
<p class='story-text'>This wasn’t just about football anymore. It was a battle for the soul of the team, a fight to become the legend Japan desperately needed.</p>
<p class='story-text'>And Kamikaze would stop at nothing to win.</p>
