    <p class='story-text'>_______________________________</p>
<p class='story-text'>I thought unlocking my potential would be like breaking chains.</p>
<p class='story-text'>But it felt more like being set on fire.</p>
<p class='story-text'>The ghost inside me didn’t resist anymore.</p>
<p class='story-text'>It welcomed me.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Merged with me.</p>
<p class='story-text'>And I saw everything.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Flashes of matches I didn’t remember. Moves I never trained. Faces of players I’d injured without knowing. A beast's path scorched behind me.</p>
<p class='story-text'>But I was faster now. Stronger. My vision stretched seconds ahead. I danced between defenders.</p>
<p class='story-text'>The crowd roared again—my name.</p>
<p class='story-text'>In a tournament match, I finally stood on the field with Ryujin and Raijin.</p>
<p class='story-text'>All of Japan watched.</p>
<p class='story-text'>For 89 minutes, I went toe-to-toe with them. I landed strikes. Stole passes.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Even broke through Raijin’s perfect feints.</p>
<p class='story-text'>I scored once. Twice.</p>
<p class='story-text'>But then the final minute came.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Ryujin changed—became unstable, like a dying star about to collapse. His playstyle dissolved into something inhuman. Not even dark—just void.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Raijin responded. He stopped moving like a man and started moving like light. A memory. A prophecy. His every touch looked effortless, but it erased everything I tried.</p>
<p class='story-text'>And in that final moment—</p>
<p class='story-text'>they combined.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Their passes, their tempo, their vision—it wasn’t 1 + 1 = 2. It was infinity.</p>
<p class='story-text'>And they crushed me.</p>
<p class='story-text'>3–2.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Defeat.</p>
<p class='story-text'>I knelt on the pitch, numb.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Even after becoming everything I feared… I was still not enough.</p>
<p class='story-text'>ACT 15: THE DEEPER TRUTH</p>
<p class='story-text'>Jin didn’t scold me.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Instead, he stood beside me in the empty stadium and whispered:</p>
<p class='story-text'>“You thought unlocking yourself was the end. It’s not. Ryujin and Raijin aren’t just strong because they’re gifted. They were forged. Together. As enemies. As brothers. As opposites in harmony. You—you're still alone.”</p>
<p class='story-text'>He looked at me. No anger. Just cold truth.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“You’re a sword without a sheath. A storm without a direction. You want to win alone? You’ll always lose.”</p>
<p class='story-text'>I felt something inside me shatter.</p>
<p class='story-text'>ACT 16: ASHES</p>
<p class='story-text'>Days passed.</p>
<p class='story-text'>No training.</p>
<p class='story-text'>No calls.</p>
<p class='story-text'>No voice inside me.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Just silence.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Until I saw Zero again.</p>
<p class='story-text'>He stood on a rooftop, watching the Tokyo skyline, his mask reflecting the sunset.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“I saw your match,” he said. “You were loud. Bright. Emotional. But that's not what wins.”</p>
<p class='story-text'>He turned to me.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“You lost because you care.”</p>
<p class='story-text'>And in that instant, I knew.</p>
<p class='story-text'>I had one match left.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Against Zero.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Not for the cup.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Not for the crowd.</p>
<p class='story-text'>But to prove that my weakness—my emotion, my chaos, my fire—was not a flaw.</p>
<p class='story-text'>It was my only weapon.</p>
