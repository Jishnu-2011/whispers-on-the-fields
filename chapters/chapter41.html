<p class='story-text'>Kickoff</p>
<p class='story-text'>The referee blows the whistle, and the ball is in play. Portugal immediately asserts control, with Bruno Fernandes orchestrating their midfield while Ronaldo prowls the attack line, eyes sharp and focused.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Japan, under the captainship of Kamikaze, lines up with a fierce determination — no fear, just raw hunger.</p>
<p class='story-text'>First Half</p>
<p class='story-text'>5’ — Portugal's quick passing causes a ripple in Japan’s backline. Ronaldo gets a through ball but Japan’s goalie, Takahashi, rushes out and blocks his shot with his legs.</p>
<p class='story-text'>12’ — Kamikaze receives a long ball at midfield, jukes past two defenders, and sprints down the right wing. He crosses into the box, but no teammate connects.</p>
<p class='story-text'>18’ — Bruno Fernandes picks up the ball at the edge of the area, curves a perfect shot — it flies just wide of the post.</p>
<p class='story-text'>22’ — Japan pushes forward. Jin steals the ball and plays a one-two with Kamikaze. Kamikaze breaks into the box, fakes a shot — defenders close in — he passes to a teammate, but the shot is blocked.</p>
<p class='story-text'>30’ — Ronaldo tries a curling shot from outside the box, but Takahashi leaps and punches it away with a strong fist.</p>
<p class='story-text'>35’ — Portugal’s midfield presses hard, forcing Japan to retreat deep into their half.</p>

<p class='story-text'>Half-time</p>
<p class='story-text'>0-0. The stadium roars, tension thick in the air.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Second Half</p>
<p class='story-text'>48’ — Japan starts aggressively. Kamikaze dribbles past two midfielders, fires a fierce volley from outside the box — the ball whistles just over the crossbar.</p>
<p class='story-text'>52’ — Portugal’s William Carvalho sends a long ball to Ronaldo, who beats the offside trap and races into the box — but Takahashi rushes out and smothers the shot.</p>
<p class='story-text'>60’ — Japan’s substitute striker makes a sharp run, crossing low — but the shot is blocked by Pepe.</p>
<p class='story-text'>65’ — Bruno Fernandes delivers a dangerous free-kick into the box — Pepe heads it, but wide.</p>
<p class='story-text'>70’ — Kamikaze drives forward again, showing brilliant close control. He slips inside, fakes a shot — defenders swarm him.</p>
<p class='story-text'>73’ — Japan gets a corner kick. Jin swings it in beautifully — the ball curls dangerously, but Portugal’s keeper catches it safely.</p>
<p class='story-text'>78’ — Ronaldo tries to break the deadlock with a powerful header off a cross — Takahashi makes a stunning save, tipping it onto the post!</p>
<p class='story-text'>82’ — Japan counters fiercely. Kamikaze unleashes a blazing shot — it’s blocked at the last second.</p>
<p class='story-text'>85’ — Both teams are visibly exhausted but keep pressing.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Extra Time</p>
<p class='story-text'>91’ — Japan takes control early in extra time. Kamikaze races down the wing, cuts inside — but the final shot is blocked.</p>
<p class='story-text'>97’ — Portugal’s Bernardo Silva tries a quick shot — blocked by Jin.</p>
<p class='story-text'>103’ — A desperate cross from Japan, Kamikaze leaps for a header — just misses.</p>
<p class='story-text'>110’ — Both teams look spent, focusing on defense.</p>
<p class='story-text'>117’ — Ronaldo shoots from distance — Takahashi catches it firmly.</p>
<p class='story-text'>120’ — The referee blows the whistle — still 0-0.</p>
