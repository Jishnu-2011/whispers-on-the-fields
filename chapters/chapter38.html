<p class='story-text'>Match 3: Japan (30) vs Saudi Arabia (28)</p>
<p class='story-text'>The stadium buzzed with restless energy. Japan, ranked 30th, was now up against Saudi Arabia, ranked 28th—a team known for their speed, stamina, and tactical discipline. This match was a narrow step up, but for Kamikaze, every game was a war for survival.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Japan was still struggling as a team. Their passes were uncertain, their defense shaky. Kamikaze started on the bench again, frustration gnawing at him. He watched the first half, noting Saudi Arabia’s quick, rhythmic play that seemed to control the game’s tempo effortlessly.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Saudi Arabia’s star midfielder, Salem Al-Dawsari, orchestrated the attacks with precision, threading passes that sliced through Japan’s disorganized defense.</p>
<p class='story-text'>The first goal came in the 33rd minute, a fast break finished by Al-Dawsari himself. Japan was down 0-1, their fans biting their nails in anxious silence.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Coach Jin finally brought Kamikaze in at halftime, hoping to ignite something in the faltering team.</p>
<p class='story-text'>The moment Kamikaze touched the pitch, he felt the Monster surge within him. His movements became sharper, more unpredictable.</p>
<p class='story-text'>He dropped deep to collect the ball, bypassing the midfield chaos with slick, purposeful dribbles. His vision opened; he could see openings no one else saw.</p>
<p class='story-text'>At 60 minutes, Kamikaze found himself one-on-one with the Saudi keeper after a brilliant solo run. The stadium held its breath.</p>
<p class='story-text'>He feinted left, then right, freezing the keeper. Then he blasted the ball into the far corner—goal!</p>
<p class='story-text'>The crowd erupted, hope flaring like a wildfire.</p>
<p class='story-text'>But Saudi Arabia didn’t fold.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Their relentless pressure paid off in the 75th minute, as a long-range shot from Al-Faraj rocketed past Japan’s keeper.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Down 1-2, Japan fought desperately in the final minutes. Kamikaze pushed the attack, his every touch electrifying.</p>
<p class='story-text'>In the 88th minute, he delivered a perfect cross that a teammate headed in—tied 2-2.</p>
<p class='story-text'>The final whistle blew. Another draw.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Japan’s team was still the worst, but Kamikaze was the brightest spark.</p>
<p class='story-text'>He was climbing — but the summit was still far.</p>
