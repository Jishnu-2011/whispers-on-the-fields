<p class='story-text'>Jin chuckled softly, shaking his head as he looked at Kamikaze.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“This World Cup? It’s nothing but a playground for beginners, amateurs. The real stage—the true warriors—are out there, in leagues you’ve never even heard of. Some of them have retired from the spotlight, but their skills? Untouchable.”</p>
<p class='story-text'>He paused, letting the weight of his words sink in.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“You think this was hard? That was just the first step, a test for rookies. The battles that really matter are in the shadows—the underground tournaments, the secret leagues where the best players who ever lived still compete.”</p>
<p class='story-text'>Kamikaze’s eyes widened, a new fire igniting inside him.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“So, you’re saying... the real challenge is still ahead?”</p>
<p class='story-text'>Jin nodded, his expression serious.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“Exactly. And if you want to be more than just a flash in the pan, you’ll need to push beyond everything you know. That’s where legends are made—and where monsters like you will be truly tested.”</p>
