    <p class='story-text'>_______________________________</p>
<p class='story-text'>The limo cut through Tokyo’s neon streets like a blade through night.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Kamikaze sat silently in the backseat. The World Cup medal hung heavy around his neck, but it felt lighter than the questions in his chest.</p>
<p class='story-text'>He stepped out at the gates of the World Class Football Program. Everything looked smaller now. Not weaker—just… human.</p>
<p class='story-text'>The training halls that once felt like a prison now felt like a graveyard of the old him.</p>
<p class='story-text'>He walked the hallway alone.</p>
<p class='story-text'>No guards.</p>
<p class='story-text'>No screaming coaches.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Just the echo of his boots—and a door at the end, still half-open, as if it had been waiting for him.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Inside, Jin stood by the window.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Same coat.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Same aura of steel and frost.</p>
<p class='story-text'>But this time, when he turned, his eyes were not filled with commands or fury.</p>
<p class='story-text'>They were calm. Studying. Proud? No. Something deeper.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“So,” Jin said. “You won.”</p>
<p class='story-text'>Kamikaze nodded.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“Ryujin. Raijin. Japan. All of it.”</p>
<p class='story-text'>“Was it worth it?” Jin asked.</p>
<p class='story-text'>A pause. Kamikaze looked at his hands. Calloused. Scarred. Still trembling.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p class='story-text'>Jin smirked faintly.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“You became what I designed… and still you ask questions. That means you surpassed the design.”</p>
<p class='story-text'>Kamikaze stepped closer.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“What now? What was the point of all this? Just to win?"</p>
<p class='story-text'>“No,” Jin said. “To survive. To find the ones who truly exist above the game. You think Zero just watches for fun?”</p>
<p class='story-text'>Kamikaze’s breath caught.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“You know him.”</p>
<p class='story-text'>Jin turned back to the window.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“I created him. Before I created you.”</p>
<p class='story-text'>Silence.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Thunder cracked outside.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Jin finally faced Kamikaze fully.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“If you want peace, walk away now. You’ve earned it. But if you still feel that fire in your blood… if the war still whispers to you…”</p>
<p class='story-text'>He tossed a file on the desk.</p>
<p class='story-text'>It read only one word: GERMANY.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“Then go find Zero. And end this.”</p>
<p class='story-text'>Kamikaze picked up the file.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Eyes burning again. But this time not with doubt.</p>
<p class='story-text'>With resolve.</p>
