<p class='story-text'>Jin’s gaze sharpened. “You’ve seen him before. You remember… don’t you? Just a glimpse. A shadow from your past. The one who waits. Watches. Challenges.”</p>
<p class='story-text'>Kamikaze closed his eyes. Flashes—half-formed memories—surged inside his mind: a cold presence on a rooftop, eyes burning with quiet power, a silhouette in the dark, silent and watching. But the details slipped away before he could grasp them fully.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“Why do I feel like I know him?” Kamikaze whispered.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Jin stepped closer, voice low but fierce. “Because you do. But he is not who you think. And he is more than just the next opponent.”</p>
<p class='story-text'>A long pause.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“You thought Ryujin and Raijin were your greatest challenge,” Jin said, “but Zero is something else entirely. The one who holds the true key to your past… and your future.”</p>
<p class='story-text'>Kamikaze’s fists clenched. His heart thundered with the fire of a thousand battles.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“If I’m to face him,” Kamikaze said, “then I’ll have to unlock more than just my power. I’ll have to unlock my memories. And the truth behind this war.”</p>
<p class='story-text'>Jin nodded once.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“Then prepare. The road to Germany will be the hardest one yet.”</p>
