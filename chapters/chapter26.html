<p class='story-text'>FIRST DAY ON THE NATIONAL TEAM</p>
<p class='story-text'>The locker room buzzed with chatter and laughter, but Kamikaze felt nothing but silence pressing down on him.</p>
<p class='story-text'>He was here. On the Japan National Team. The dream was real.</p>
<p class='story-text'>But the truth hit harder than any tackle—Zero, the very player who had dominated the Nationals and secured his spot on this squad, was seen by everyone as the best.</p>
<p class='story-text'>And Kamikaze? He felt like trash in comparison. A forgotten afterthought.</p>
<p class='story-text'>He watched Zero with clenched fists—how effortlessly Zero controlled the ball, how the coaches praised his vision and precision. Yet, beneath that flawless surface, Kamikaze’s anger simmered. If this was the “best” Japan had to offer, then maybe that was exactly why Japan had never won the World Cup in its entire history.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Zero was the golden boy on paper, but to Kamikaze, he represented the fragile ceiling Japan kept hitting—always talented, but never truly unstoppable.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Kamikaze’s chest burned with frustration.</p>
<p class='story-text'>He wasn’t going to accept being the benchwarmer forever. Not when he had to carry the weight of a nation that had never tasted World Cup glory.</p>
<p class='story-text'>If Zero was the benchmark, Kamikaze vowed—he’d shatter it.</p>
<p class='story-text'>"I guess thats the reason im a substitute"</p>
