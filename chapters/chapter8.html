    <p class='story-text'>_______________________________THE LOSS THAT BURNED</p>
<p class='story-text'>The next match, I insisted on playing with full control—no blackouts, no ghost. Just me.</p>
<p class='story-text'>And I failed.</p>
<p class='story-text'>We faced Ryujin Academy. Ryujin was a force of chaos—his style was black lightning, unpredictable and destructive. He danced through our defense like a shadow with blades.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Raijin, in contrast, moved like light—effortless, graceful, pure. The ball obeyed him as if drawn to him by gravity.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Together, they tore us apart.</p>
<p class='story-text'>And then, the penalty. My chance to redeem myself.</p>
<p class='story-text'>But the ball slipped.</p>
<p class='story-text'>It was like my foot forgot the one thing it was born to do.</p>
<p class='story-text'>The silence after the miss was louder than any roar.</p>
<p class='story-text'>I collapsed to my knees.</p>
<p class='story-text'>And for the first time in my life, I wished I had never been born.</p>
