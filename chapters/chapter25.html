<p class='story-text'>Making the Japan squad for the World Cup felt like a dream come true. The weight of the bench no longer crushed him as heavily—he was here, part of the elite. The stadiums, the crowds, the global stage—it all shimmered with promise.</p>
<p class='story-text'>But the promise was tangled with a sting of reality.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Zero wasn’t a legend or a shadowy rival cloaked in mystery.</p>
<p class='story-text'>He was the worst player in the world.</p>
<p class='story-text'>That’s what Kamikaze heard whispered in locker rooms, in corridors, behind closed doors.</p>
<p class='story-text'>The same Zero who haunted his memories, the figure watching from rooftops—turns out he was a failed prodigy, constantly benched, endlessly criticized. A player with raw talent but crippled by nerves, mistakes, and missed opportunities.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Kamikaze’s heart sank.</p>
<p class='story-text'>If Zero was that bad, then who was he supposed to fear? Who was the real challenge?</p>
<p class='story-text'>But deep inside, a fire sparked.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Zero’s failure was a warning, a mirror. Kamikaze wasn’t at the top yet either. He still had a long, brutal road ahead.</p>
<p class='story-text'>If the world’s worst player was still part of this stage, that meant the bar was far from unreachable.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Kamikaze tightened his jaw, gripping the edge of his seat.</p>
<p class='story-text'>The journey wasn’t over.</p>
<p class='story-text'>It was only beginning.</p>
