<p class='story-text'>Endless Defeat — The Crushing Reality</p>
<p class='story-text'>The stadiums blurred into a nightmare of relentless defeat. Match after match, Kamikaze and his dream team faced the brutal truth: they were losing, and not just by a little. Loss piled upon loss like an avalanche, drowning every spark of hope.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Noel Noa’s supremacy was absolute. Each time they stepped on the pitch, the champion dismantled them with ruthless efficiency. His speed was lightning, his technique flawless, his strategy a masterclass in destruction.</p>
<p class='story-text'>The scoreboard became a cruel reminder of their helplessness. Game after game, the numbers grew darker — 10-0, 25-0, 50-0 — until it reached an unimaginable abyss: 100-0.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Kamikaze’s monster roared in frustration, shaking the core of his being. Every shot missed, every pass intercepted, every defensive line broken. Their skills, their training, their passion — nothing could break the wall that was Noel Noa.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Their spirits wavered, their bodies grew exhausted, but surrender was never an option. With every crushing defeat, their resolve hardened. This was their crucible — a war of endurance where only true monsters would survive.</p>
<p class='story-text'>After the 100-0 Final Match</p>
<p class='story-text'>The crowd was silent, shocked by the scale of the defeat. But Kamikaze’s eyes burned brighter than ever. Beside him, the monster whispered, “You haven’t lost yourself. You’ve only been tempered. Now, we rise.”</p>
