<p class='story-text'>From that day forward, Kamikaze’s world shrank to one thing: training.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Every morning before dawn, his legs burned as he sprinted until his lungs screamed for air. Every night, sweat soaked his clothes as he dribbled, passed, and shot under the dim glow of the stadium lights.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Pain became his closest companion—aching muscles, blistered feet, and a heart pounding like thunder.</p>
<p class='story-text'>No rest. No mercy.</p>
<p class='story-text'>He pushed harder than ever before, chasing a ghost he barely understood but feared deeply—Noel Noa, the unstoppable storm looming over his dreams.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Jin’s words echoed relentlessly in his mind:</p>
<p class='story-text'>“Noel Noa commands the game. To beat him, you must become more than a player—you must become a force.”</p>
<p class='story-text'>Kamikaze trained until his body trembled, until the line between exhaustion and fury blurred. Every drop of blood, every scar was a promise: he would be ready.</p>
<p class='story-text'>THE BREAKING POINT</p>
<p class='story-text'>Day after day, Kamikaze ignored every warning his body screamed.</p>
<p class='story-text'>He ran faster, pushed harder, trained longer—until one evening, under the burning sunset sky, everything shattered.</p>
<p class='story-text'>His legs buckled. The world tilted. A fierce pain gripped his chest like iron claws squeezing tight.</p>
<p class='story-text'>He gasped for air, heart pounding wildly, but something was wrong—terribly wrong.</p>
<p class='story-text'>The sharp, searing pain spread through his chest, racing up to his jaw and down his arm.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Kamikaze collapsed to the ground, clutching his chest, sweat pouring from his brow, vision blurring.</p>
<p class='story-text'>A heart attack.</p>
<p class='story-text'>His dream, his war, had brought him to the edge.</p>
<p class='story-text'>As darkness crept in, his mind screamed one thought:</p>
<p class='story-text'>Was this what it cost to become a force?</p>
