<p class='story-text'>THE CLASH OF LEGENDS</p>
<p class='story-text'>The first time I stood on the training ground of the Japan National Youth Team, I felt it—pressure thick enough to choke.</p>
<p class='story-text'>There they were.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Ryujin.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Hair like smoke. Eyes like a black hole. His movements: unpredictable, cruel, devouring. Dark matter made human.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Raijin.</p>
<p class='story-text'>The opposite. Golden eyes. Calm footsteps. A stillness before the strike. He moved like music, perfect and untouchable.</p>
<p class='story-text'>They didn’t speak to me.</p>
<p class='story-text'>They didn’t need to.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Their eyes said everything:</p>
<p class='story-text'>"You are nothing."</p>
<p class='story-text'>And yet—I felt no fear.</p>
<p class='story-text'>I burned.</p>
<p class='story-text'>We clashed in a practice match.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Me vs them.</p>
<p class='story-text'>They toyed with me at first. Ryujin’s chaos rattled my timing. Raijin read my every step like a book he'd already memorized.</p>
<p class='story-text'>But then the other me awakened again.</p>
<p class='story-text'>And for a moment—just a blink—I slipped past both.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Split them open with a strike that cracked the crossbar.</p>
<p class='story-text'>The field went silent.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Then Ryujin laughed.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“You think this is the summit?” he said.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Raijin’s voice followed, ice-cold:</p>
<p class='story-text'>“We were just your test. The real enemy’s inside.”</p>
