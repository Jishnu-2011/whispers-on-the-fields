<p class='story-text'>Match 4: Japan (30) vs Tunisia (20)</p>
<p class='story-text'>The heat of the midday sun beat down on the pitch as Japan prepared to face Tunisia, ranked 20th. Tunisia was a tougher opponent—solid defense, quick counter-attacks, and a physical style that tested every player’s endurance.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Japan’s team was still disjointed, but Kamikaze was starting to gain respect from his teammates. Today, he was starting on the field as a striker — a small victory.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Right from kickoff, Tunisia pressed hard. Their captain, Wahbi Khazri, directed plays with experience, launching attacks down the wings.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Japan struggled to hold possession, and the crowd’s nervous energy was palpable.</p>
<p class='story-text'>In the 22nd minute, Tunisia scored from a corner kick — a powerful header by Ellyes Skhiri.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Japan was down, and the players’ frustration showed.</p>
<p class='story-text'>But Kamikaze refused to back down.</p>
<p class='story-text'>He used every bit of training, every ounce of the Monster’s strength, weaving through defenders with dazzling dribbles.</p>
<p class='story-text'>In the 39th minute, Kamikaze scored a brilliant goal — a curling shot from outside the box that left the keeper frozen.</p>
<p class='story-text'>The stadium erupted.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Half-time came with the score tied 1-1.</p>
<p class='story-text'>In the second half, the game turned brutal.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Tunisia’s defense tightened, and Japan’s attacks were repeatedly thwarted.</p>
<p class='story-text'>At 70 minutes, Kamikaze was fouled hard, earning a free kick.</p>
<p class='story-text'>With icy focus, he took the kick himself.</p>
<p class='story-text'>The ball sailed over the wall, dipping just under the crossbar—goal!</p>
<p class='story-text'>Japan led 2-1.</p>
<p class='story-text'>For the final 20 minutes, the team fought with everything.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Despite Tunisia’s fierce efforts, Japan held on.</p>
<p class='story-text'>The whistle blew.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Victory.</p>
<p class='story-text'>For Kamikaze, the first real win with the national team.</p>
<p class='story-text'>But the climb was only getting steeper.</p>
