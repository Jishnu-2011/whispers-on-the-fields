<p class='story-text'>Jin’s eyes gleamed with intensity as he looked straight into Kamikaze’s.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“If you think the World Cup was the ultimate battleground,” Jin said slowly, voice low and heavy with meaning, “then you haven’t seen anything yet. The real test lies ahead — the Egoesta Champions League.”</p>
<p class='story-text'>He paused, letting the weight of his words settle.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“That’s where true monsters are born. Where legends are forged in fire and only the strongest survive. It’s beyond national pride, beyond everything you’ve faced so far.”</p>
<p class='story-text'>Jin’s tone turned almost conspiratorial.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“Get ready, because if you want to be the best, if you want to surpass Noel Noa and everyone else, the Egoesta Champions League is where you prove it. The real war begins there.”</p>
