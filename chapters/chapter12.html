<p class='story-text'>THE SHADOW</p>
<p class='story-text'>That night, Jin summoned me. Alone.</p>
<p class='story-text'>His office was dim, the only light a flickering screen showing dozens of player profiles.</p>
<p class='story-text'>He turned to me.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“You’re not the only one with a ghost inside you,” he said.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“Every top player in this world—Raijin, Ryujin, Riku—each of them carries a second soul. But yours… yours is unstable.”</p>
<p class='story-text'>I asked him what he meant.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“You weren’t born with talent, Kamikaze. You stole it. In the wreckage of your collapse, something else moved in. A predator. A remnant of an ancient player—one who was erased from history because he broke the code. He didn’t play for glory. He played to destroy.”</p>
<p class='story-text'>I couldn’t breathe.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Was I even me anymore?</p>
<p class='story-text'>Or just a vessel?</p>
<p class='story-text'>“You can’t beat Ryujin and Raijin by training harder,” Jin said.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“You need to confront the thing inside you. Or it will eat you alive.”</p>
