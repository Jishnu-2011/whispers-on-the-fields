    <p class='story-text'>_______________________________</p>
<p class='story-text'>With Monster’s power unlocking his true potential, Kamikaze’s style transformed. No longer just a dribbler weaving through defenses, he became a lethal striker — the spearhead of Japan’s attack.</p>
<p class='story-text'>His shots burned with the fury of his spirit, precise and unstoppable. He hunted the goal like a predator, every touch purposeful, every strike a threat. The crowd began to whisper his name with awe — Kamikaze, the unstoppable striker.</p>
<p class='story-text'>But even as he scored goal after goal, the harsh truth remained: the Japan team was the worst in the tournament. Their defense crumbled, their passes faltered, and their cohesion was shattered. Kamikaze fought alone at the tip of an unraveling spear.</p>
<p class='story-text'>He became the team’s shining beacon — the striker who could pierce any defense, yet trapped in a squad that couldn’t hold the line or support his charge.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Every goal was a victory for himself, a solitary triumph amid a team sinking deeper.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Yet the fire inside him only blazed brighter. Kamikaze wasn’t just playing for goals anymore — he was fighting to carry an entire nation on his back.</p>
