<p class='story-text'>Jin pulled Kamikaze aside amid the roaring celebrations, his eyes sharp and serious despite the festive chaos.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“Enjoy this moment, Kami,” Jin said, clapping a firm hand on his shoulder. “But don’t forget — you still haven’t faced Noel Noa. The world champion. The real battle is just beginning.”</p>
<p class='story-text'>Kamikaze’s smile faded for a moment, replaced by a steely resolve. The victory was sweet, but Jin was right. The mountain ahead was even higher.</p>
<p class='story-text'>With the cheers echoing all around, Kamikaze nodded slowly, the fire of determination blazing brighter than ever in his eyes. “Then I’ll be ready,” he said quietly. “Noel Noa won’t know what hit him.”</p>
