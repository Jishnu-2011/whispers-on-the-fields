<p class='story-text'>The roar of the crowd still echoed in the stadium as the players caught their breath. The draw against Noel Noa wasn’t just a result — it was a revelation. The Dream Team had pushed a seemingly invincible force to its limits. Yet, for Kamikaze, the battle was far from over.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Every player on the Dream Team felt the fire ignite within them, but none burned brighter than Kamikaze’s. The taste of almost beating Noel Noa — and falling just short — fueled an obsession. His training became relentless, surpassing even the grueling routines of the past.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Early mornings blurred into late nights. Sweat dripped, muscles screamed, but Kamikaze pushed beyond pain, tapping deeper into the power of the “monster” inside him. His dribbling sharpened, his speed increased, and his instincts grew razor-sharp.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Zero and Jin watched with pride as Kamikaze transformed before their eyes. The team’s chemistry improved too, each player learning to flow with Kamikaze’s explosive style. They weren’t just teammates — they were a well-oiled machine, growing stronger, faster, and smarter every day.</p>
<p class='story-text'>The Dream Team’s reputation soared worldwide. Scouts, coaches, and fans watched as they climbed the ranks, each match teaching them something new — a better defense, a trickier pass, a bolder strike.</p>
<p class='story-text'>And Kamikaze? He no longer feared defeat. Instead, he embraced it as fuel. Each loss, each challenge, was a stepping stone on his path to mastery.</p>
<p class='story-text'>The dream of finally surpassing Noel Noa became a beacon — a goal worth every drop of sweat and every aching muscle.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Because this time, Kamikaze wasn’t just playing football — he was rewriting his destiny.</p>
