    <p class='story-text'>_______________________________</p>
<p class='story-text'>Kamikaze lay on the scorched earth, chest heaving, each breath a battle against an invisible enemy squeezing the life from him.</p>
<p class='story-text'>His vision dimmed, the world fading into a cold abyss.</p>
<p class='story-text'>The roaring silence inside his head was louder than any stadium cheer.</p>
<p class='story-text'>He was on the edge — a thin line between life and oblivion.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Memories flashed—his mother’s voice, Jin’s steely gaze, the shattered dreams, the burning desire to win.</p>
<p class='story-text'>But now, in this cruel moment, all those dreams seemed so fragile, so distant.</p>
<p class='story-text'>He wanted to fight—he had to fight.</p>
<p class='story-text'>But his body betrayed him, slipping into darkness.</p>
