<p class='story-text'>Match 1: Japan (30) vs Canada (29) — The Breakthrough Battle</p>
<p class='story-text'>The stadium was buzzing under a cold sky. Japan, ranked 30th, faced Canada at 29th — just a step above, but every step was a mountain for Kamikaze.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Canada’s wing wizard, Alphonso Davies, was already known as a nightmare for defenders. His lightning pace and sharp cuts made him the perfect storm on the left flank. From the first whistle, Davies exploded down the wing, sending waves of pressure.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Kamikaze, watching from the bench, felt his heart pound. The dark Monster inside him whispered, “Show them who you really are.”</p>
<p class='story-text'>As the game started, Kamikaze was subbed in during the 60th minute when Japan was down 1-0. The moment he stepped onto the pitch, the energy shifted. His movements were fluid but aggressive, blending his unrelenting training and Monster’s raw power.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Canada’s defenders tried to contain him. Davies challenged Kamikaze again and again, but Kamikaze’s dribbling was a twisted dance — sharp cuts, sudden stops, then bursts forward.</p>
<p class='story-text'>In the 72nd minute, Kamikaze received a perfect through ball near the edge of the penalty box. His eyes locked on the goal, and with a flash of Monster’s dark aura, he feinted left, then cut right, leaving a defender sprawling on the ground.</p>
<p class='story-text'>He unleashed a fierce volley — the ball curved beautifully, slamming into the top corner. The stadium exploded.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Japan equalized.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Canada pushed hard to regain the lead. Davies crossed again, but Kamikaze’s dark presence seemed to shadow every pass. He intercepted a dangerous cross and started a fast counterattack.</p>
<p class='story-text'>By the 85th minute, Kamikaze sprinted through the midfield. The ball glued to his feet, he weaved past two defenders and, with a subtle flick, passed to a teammate who buried the second goal.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Japan had come from behind to lead 2-1.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Canada fought till the final whistle but Kamikaze and the team held their nerve.</p>
<p class='story-text'>After the match, Kamikaze sat alone under the stadium lights. The Monster inside him had pushed him beyond his limits, but he knew this was just the first battle in a long war.</p>
