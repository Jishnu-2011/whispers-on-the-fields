<p class='story-text'>Jin’s voice dropped to a whisper, leaning closer to Kamikaze as the crowd’s roar faded into the background.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“This has been a secret, Kami… but you still haven’t seen the outside world. The real battles, the true scale of what’s out there — it’s far beyond what you’ve faced so far.”</p>
<p class='story-text'>Kamikaze’s brow furrowed, a mix of curiosity and caution flickering in his eyes.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“The World Cup,” Jin continued, “it’s only the beginning. Beyond this stadium, beyond these matches, lies a world of challenges that will push you to your absolute limits.”</p>
<p class='story-text'>A chill ran down Kamikaze’s spine. The path ahead wasn’t just about football — it was about survival, growth, and facing shadows he hadn’t yet imagined.</p>
<p class='story-text'>He clenched his fists, heart pounding with anticipation. “Then I’ll prepare for everything. No matter how big the world is, I’ll carve my place in it.”</p>
<p class='story-text'>Jin smiled, a knowing glint in his eye. “Good. Because that’s what it takes to become a legend.”</p>
