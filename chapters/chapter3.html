<p class='story-text'>THE INITIATION</p>
<p class='story-text'>That night I collapsed on the floor, football in hand, no bed, no pillow—just me and the cold, hard ground. I don’t even remember falling asleep. But I woke up to chaos. A ball smacked into my chest. Kids were yelling. One charged at me in a tag match. I moved without thinking. My foot lashed out and nailed him in the face. Blood. Screams. Panic. But somehow, I’d passed. I was in. I’d made it through the entrance test, whether by luck, instinct, or something still buried inside me. That’s when he appeared. Jin. The man behind the World Class Program. Ice in his eyes, voice like steel. He looked straight through us and said words that carved themselves into my bones: “𝖎𝖋 𝖞𝖔𝖚 𝖙𝖍𝖎𝖓𝖐 𝖙𝖍𝖆𝖙 𝖘𝖔𝖈𝖈𝖊𝖗 𝖎𝖘 𝖆 𝖌𝖆𝖒𝖊 𝖕𝖑𝖆𝖞𝖊𝖉 𝖇𝖞 11 𝖕𝖑𝖆𝖞𝖊𝖗𝖘 𝖙𝖔 𝖜𝖎𝖓, 𝖞𝖔𝖚 𝖆𝖗𝖊 𝖆𝖓 𝖋𝖆𝖎𝖑𝖚𝖗𝖊. 𝖘𝖔𝖈𝖈𝖊𝖗 𝖎𝖘 𝖆 𝖜𝖆𝖗.
