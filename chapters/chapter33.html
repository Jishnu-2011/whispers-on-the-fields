<p class='story-text'>With Monster by his side, Kamikaze unlocked a new level of skill — lightning-fast reflexes, razor-sharp dribbling, and an uncanny ability to read the field like a chess master. On the pitch, he became a tempest, weaving through defenders with impossible grace and power.</p>
<p class='story-text'>But outside his own brilliance, the Japan team was still a sinking ship — plagued by weak passes, sloppy defense, and a lack of cohesion that made them the worst of the worst at the World Cup.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Kamikaze’s dazzling dribbles and explosive plays dazzled crowds and opponents alike, but no matter how hard he fought, his teammates couldn’t keep up. It was like running a race alone, dragging a broken cart behind him.</p>
<p class='story-text'>He surpassed everyone — not just Ryujin or Raijin anymore — but even his own team. They relied on him as a one-man army, but the weight of their failures pressed on him heavier than ever.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Every goal he scored was a flash of brilliance in a dark storm.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Every victory was bittersweet, because deep down, he knew: no matter how much he grew, the team was still falling apart around him.</p>
<p class='story-text'>And that loneliness? It fueled his rage and determination even more.</p>
<p class='story-text'>If he was going to carry Japan, he’d become unstoppable.</p>
