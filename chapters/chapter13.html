<p class='story-text'>THE UNDERGROUND GAME</p>
<p class='story-text'>One night, I was led underground—to a hidden facility beneath the stadium.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Jin called it the Zero Field.</p>
<p class='story-text'>It was where banned matches happened. Where monsters were trained in secret. Where the national team’s true formation was chosen—not by skill, but by survival.</p>
<p class='story-text'>I saw him there.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Zero.</p>
<p class='story-text'>A boy with no name. Masked. Silent. Unbeaten.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Even Raijin and Ryujin bowed their heads when he walked past.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“He’s the final striker,” Jin whispered. “If you survive long enough, you'll face him.”</p>
<p class='story-text'>I felt my blood freeze.</p>
<p class='story-text'>All this time, I thought I was fighting Ryujin and Raijin.</p>
<p class='story-text'>But they were the warm-up.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Zero was the final war.</p>
<p class='story-text'>And the thing inside me?</p>
<p class='story-text'>It wanted to meet him.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Not to win.</p>
<p class='story-text'>But to destroy him.</p>
<p class='story-text'>And take his place.</p>
