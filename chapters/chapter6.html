<p class='story-text'>Then there was Riku. A shadow in my path. His eyes always on me—cold, calculating, silent. He never spoke much, but when he did, his words pierced like knives.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“You think you can lead this team?” he scoffed one night after practice, his voice low enough for only me to hear. “You’re not even a real striker.”</p>
<p class='story-text'>I didn’t reply. I didn’t need to.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Because every time we stepped onto the field, the real war began.</p>
<p class='story-text'>We weren’t teammates—we were predators sharing the same hunting ground. Every sprint was a race. Every shot was a challenge.</p>
<p class='story-text'>And then one day, he disappeared.</p>
<p class='story-text'>They said he transferred to the Raijin Academy—home of the twin gods of Japanese football: Raijin and Ryujin.</p>
<p class='story-text'>That’s when I knew.</p>
<p class='story-text'>I wasn’t just fighting Riku anymore. I was chasing ghosts. Legends.</p>
