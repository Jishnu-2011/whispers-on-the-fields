    <p class='story-text'>_______________________________</p>
<p class='story-text'>Kamikaze collapsed, his body heavy and broken — but it wasn’t a heart attack.</p>
<p class='story-text'>His soul was ripped free from flesh and bone, flung into a place of pure, endless blackness.</p>
<p class='story-text'>There was no light, no sound—only darkness so complete it swallowed everything whole.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Yet, even in that void, Kamikaze saw.</p>
<p class='story-text'>He saw it all—memories, moments, the path he had traveled.</p>
<p class='story-text'>And then he saw himself.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Not the Kamikaze he knew, but a stranger—his past self, a shadowed figure he’d never met, yet somehow recognized.</p>
<p class='story-text'>That ghostly form hovered before him, dark aura swirling, vast and consuming.</p>
<p class='story-text'>The darkness it emitted was so deep and cold that Kamikaze’s bones trembled, cracking under its weight.</p>
<p class='story-text'>A shiver ran through him like ice shards, splitting his soul apart.</p>
<p class='story-text'>He was face to face with a power buried deep within—something wild, raw, and terrifying.</p>
<p class='story-text'>And as he floated downward into the abyss, he understood:</p>
<p class='story-text'>The dark figure’s voice echoed in the void — low, rough, and unsettling.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“I have no name,” it said, voice like distant thunder rumbling through the blackness.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“Call me... Monster.”</p>
<p class='story-text'>The word hung in the air like a curse, heavy and cold.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Kamikaze’s heart (or what was left of it) trembled.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Monster’s aura pulsed — a deep shadow of raw power and endless rage.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“I am what you fear. What you try to hide,” Monster whispered.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“But I am also your strength. Your darkness forged into a weapon.”</p>
<p class='story-text'>Kamikaze stared into the abyssal eyes of Monster, feeling a storm raging inside himself.</p>
<p class='story-text'>The shattering of his bones wasn’t pain.</p>
<p class='story-text'>It was the breaking of old chains.</p>
