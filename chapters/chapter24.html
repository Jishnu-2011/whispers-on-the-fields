<p class='story-text'>The roar of the stadium faded into the background as Kamikaze sat on the cold bench, jersey damp with sweat, heart pounding in his chest. The Nationals Cup was over — he had won. But now, in the big league, the Japan National Team, he was once again a substitute. A bencher.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Raijin and Ryujin, his old rivals, prowled the field like gods, playing with their signature contrasting styles — Raijin’s graceful, clean precision like the calm before a storm, Ryujin’s chaotic, dark-matter energy ripping through defenses like a black hole consuming light.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Kamikaze clenched his fists, bitterness rising like fire in his veins. He had poured everything into that victory, unlocked every ounce of potential, yet here he was — sidelined, watching legends play while his name rarely left the coach’s lips.</p>
<p class='story-text'>And yet… in the back of his mind, a shadow stirred. A fleeting memory, barely there — a figure watching the match from a rooftop, eyes piercing, cold. Zero.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Who was he? Why did Kamikaze feel like he’d seen him before — a ghost from the past that refused to be forgotten?</p>
<p class='story-text'>As the cheers thundered around him, Kamikaze gritted his teeth.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“This isn’t over.”</p>
<p class='story-text'>He didn’t know what lay ahead. He only knew one thing — to face Ryujin and Raijin again, to finally prove himself, he would have to confront not just his rivals… but the mystery that haunted him from the shadows.</p>
<p class='story-text'>And when the time came, he would be ready.</p>
