    <p class='story-text'>_______________________________</p>
<p class='story-text'>The final whistle blew.</p>
<p class='story-text'>No confetti rained.</p>
<p class='story-text'>No gods descended.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Just a sound. A truth.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Kamikaze had done it.</p>
<p class='story-text'>He beat Raijin, graceful as lightning.</p>
<p class='story-text'>He surpassed Ryujin, chaos incarnate.</p>
<p class='story-text'>He scored the winning goal for Japan.</p>
<p class='story-text'>And now?</p>
<p class='story-text'>He sat in silence.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Wrapped in a thick hotel robe, staring at a feast that could feed kings. Wagyu beef. Tuna belly. Golden miso soup. Fluffy rice. Champagne sparkled in crystal glasses.</p>
<p class='story-text'>But Kamikaze didn’t move.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“I thought I’d feel different,” he muttered.</p>
<p class='story-text'>The TV murmured match replays. His teammates screamed in celebration down the hall. Cameras flashed, and somewhere in Tokyo, a parade was forming in his name.</p>
<p class='story-text'>But none of it reached him.</p>
<p class='story-text'>He chewed slowly. Mechanical.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Not satisfied. Not hungry. Just… waiting.</p>
<p class='story-text'>And that’s when he heared it.</p>
<p class='story-text'>A flicker. A gaze. Somewhere far above.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Like a big challege incoming</p>
