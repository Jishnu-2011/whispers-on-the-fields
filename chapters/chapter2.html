<p class='story-text'>THE STRUGGLE & THE CHOICE</p>
<p class='story-text'>I dragged myself through breakfast, staring into my cereal while watching clips of Raijin and Ryujin tearing through defenders like monsters. They were pure chaos on the field—brothers, rivals, legends. The kind of players who could score in their sleep. And me? I was nothing. Trash. A washed-up benchwarmer on a school team that barely had enough players to function. Once, I was a top striker. Feared. Respected. Now I was shoved to the left wing like a forgotten toy, and every time I touched the ball, it felt like my feet didn’t know me anymore. We lost again. Because of me. Again. After the match, I didn’t say a word. I got on my cycle and rode like a madman, fast and furious, until the pain in my lungs drowned out the pain in my heart. I screamed into the wind, a raw, broken thing. I hated myself. I wanted to quit. I wanted to burn my boots and walk away. But when I got home, mom handed me two letters. One from the national basketball team. One from a mysterious elite training program called the "World Class Football Program." I didn’t think. I chose football. Not because I believed in myself. Not because I thought I could be great. I chose it because it was the only thing that made me feel alive.</p>
