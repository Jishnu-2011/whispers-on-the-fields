    <h2>Chapter 35</h2>

  <main>
    <p class='story-text'>_______________________________</p>
<p class='story-text'>The road ahead was merciless.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Forty-eight teams. Forty-eight battles.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Each one tougher than the last.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Kamikaze knew this wasn’t just a tournament — it was a war for honor, pride, and survival.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Every match was a mountain he had to climb alone, carrying the weight of a team too weak to keep pace.</p>
<p class='story-text'>But he didn’t flinch.</p>
<p class='story-text'>With Monster by his side, and the fire in his veins, he vowed to fight each battle with everything he had.</p>
<p class='story-text'>From ruthless defenders in Brazil to cunning midfielders in Spain, from aggressive forwards in France to tactical giants in Germany — every opponent was a wall he had to break through.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Every victory brought him closer to the summit, closer to the ultimate goal.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Noel Noa, the world champion, loomed at the top — a shadow waiting to crush him.</p>
<p class='story-text'>But Kamikaze’s eyes burned with a new resolve.</p>
<p class='story-text'>He wasn’t just fighting to win. He was fighting to prove that even the weakest team could rise — if only one warrior dared to carry the flame.</p>
