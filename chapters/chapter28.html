<p class='story-text'>THE NEW TARGET — NOEL NOA</p>
<p class='story-text'>After another brutal training session, Jin called Kamikaze into the cold, empty gym. The flickering lights cast long shadows across the polished floor.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Jin’s eyes locked onto Kamikaze’s, ice sharp and unyielding.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“You thought Zero was your final challenge?” Jin’s voice was low, almost a growl. “Zero was just the first step—the gateway. Your real target is Noel Noa.”</p>
<p class='story-text'>Kamikaze swallowed hard. The name hit him like a thunderclap.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Noel Noa—the world champion. The player who ruled the pitch with a ruthless elegance that had crushed legends. The man whose reputation alone made entire teams crumble before kickoff.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Jin took a step closer, his voice dropping to a whisper that seemed to crawl beneath Kamikaze’s skin.</p>
<p class='story-text'>“He is a storm wrapped in light and shadow, faster than your eyes can follow, stronger than your mind can imagine. He doesn’t just play football—he commands it. When Noel Noa steps onto the field, the whole world watches and waits to see who will break first.”</p>
<p class='story-text'>Kamikaze’s bones shivered. The chill wasn’t from the cold.</p>
<p class='story-text'>This was no ordinary opponent.</p>
<p class='story-text'>This was a war.</p>
