<p class='story-text'>THE DREAM & THE FALL</p>
<p class='story-text'>I had the dream again. It always starts the same way—the Champions League final. Floodlights blaze down on the pitch, fans scream my name from every corner of the stadium, and I feel like a god. The ball rockets toward me, spinning mid-air, and I rise to meet it. Time slows. My foot connects with the ball in a perfect volley, and it erupts—dragonic energy flaring from the seams: red fire, black lightning, golden trails that streak like comets. It curves like it’s alive, weaving past defenders, past the keeper, slamming into the net with an explosion of glory. The crowd erupts, and suddenly my teammates are on me—Messi, Ronaldo, Mbappé, Raijin and Ryujin—lifting me up like I’m the king of the world. I wasn’t just a star. I was the one. The best. And then, just as quickly, the dream shatters. My mom’s voice slices through the fantasy like a knife through silk: "Kamikaze! Wake up! You’ll miss school!" The roaring crowd fades into silence. I open my eyes to my cracked ceiling. No stadium. No goal. No legends. Just me. Kamikaze. Another nobody with a stupid dream.</p>
