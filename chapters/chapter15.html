<p class='story-text'>💀 WHAT MAKES ZERO DIFFERENT?</p>
<p class='story-text'>1. No Emotion</p>
<p class='story-text'>Zero doesn’t celebrate goals. Doesn’t shout. Doesn’t flinch.</p>
<p class='story-text'>His play is cold, clinical, terrifying.</p>
<p class='story-text'>He doesn’t win with power or chaos—he wins with mathematical inevitability.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Every move is pre-calculated. Every touch drains hope.</p>
<p class='story-text'>2. The Anti-Kamikaze</p>
<p class='story-text'>Kamikaze plays with heart → Zero plays with silence</p>
<p class='story-text'>Kamikaze is raw, impulsive, emotional → Zero is pure logic</p>
<p class='story-text'>Kamikaze wants to prove his worth → Zero exists as if it’s already proven</p>
<p class='story-text'>3. Mirror of the Past</p>
<p class='story-text'>Some say Zero used to be like Kamikaze—fiery, chaotic, human.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Until Jin broke him down.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Erased his identity.</p>
<p class='story-text'>Rebuilt him as the perfect machine.</p>
<p class='story-text'>He is called “Zero” because that’s what remains when you strip away ego, emotion, identity.</p>
